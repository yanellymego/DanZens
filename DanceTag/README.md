# DanceTag
DanceTag is a Unity-based motion capture tool used to record and annotate dance movements using Sony's Mocopi wearable sensors.

## Features
- Real-time motion capture
- Sensor-based body tracking
- Export of movement data for analysis in DanceVis

## Availability
DanceTag serves as a data collection interface and requires physical sensor hardware to operate. It does not provide a standalone demo mode. For this reason, the Unity application is not distributed in this repository.
